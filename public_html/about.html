			<h1>About Us</h1>

			<h3>The History of Game Space</h3>
			<p>Game Space was founded on August 31st, 2017. The gaming industry at this point in time was flourishing, but we felt there was still room for improvement. That's where we come in. We founded Game Space to fill a space that was left behind by the golden years of gaming bliss. No other companies provide the same quality in their gaming review / retail services.</p>

			<h3>Our Employees</h3>
			<p>Game Space is nothing without our employees. We only hire the best of the best. Employees go through a rigorous training process in order to truly understand the meaning of hardcore gaming, and how we can share that knowledge with our loyal customers. We realize that our customers are hardcore gamers, just like us, so we give them equally hardcore service.</p>
